# Currently doing
Looking for a jump into the software engineering and machine learning industry while keeping my game development as a side passion/hobby. I also have some interest in computer vision specifically. I like to think of ways to automate redundant tasks and simplify my life through my computer but have fun making games as someone who grew up playing video games and still do now.

I'm learning tensorflow w/ keras and trying to get a better grasp of AI training and models such as transformers (generative), genetic algorithms, and supervised learning. I also want to implement a game character AI that can traverse obstacle courses given raycasts and a destination from scratch, with some progress in predictions but not yet in training.

## My game development career
I have only published one game (currently work in progress but I have not worked on it for a few years now) on Roblox. I can't post about this online since I would like to not give up my identity (just like a pen name), but I would not mind talking about it in a broader perspective (interviews).

I've been part-time self-employed to some extent with some startup game developers (often logistical game features rather than frontend or complex physics) during 2019-2021. I often had to communicate with people from other countries and it taught me valuable digital communication, especially when time was important.

I have previous experience in Unity from 2022 and currently develop in that engine for my co-op position as a game developer at GDAP Studio that aims to make games for nonprofit communities in either Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot.

## Programming Languages & Developer Tools
I learned Lua for many years but I am now proficient in C, Java, Python, and C# (Unity). I also did JavaScript when I was doing web design including HTML and CSS. I did Racket for coursework.

Other than Git, I have learned Perforce for collaboration with artists and designers. I used Docker and implemented a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack website for a insurance claims email text processing demo during Codefest 2024 (ClaimAssist). 

I am familiar with matplotlib, tensorflow w/ keras, numpy, some pandas/opencv. I learned mySQL including in Python but do not work in it normally. I am also familiar in Vim, VS Code, and IntelliJ.
