# Currently doing
Looking for a jump into the software engineering industry while keeping my game development as a side passion/hobby. In fact, I plan to soon go back and work on one of my games that needs dusting.

I'm self-learning React and have current interest in finding a fun way to use neural network AI models (looked into Pandas, Tensorflow, etc). Specifically, I have been curious about making a player bot that can learn to play obstacle courses. This is inspired by bots in Geometry Dash that are seemingly trained on a level's data and can complete levels that are made to be humanly impossible but physically (or theoretically) possible.

## My game development career
I have only published one game (currently work in progress but I have not worked on it for a few years now) on Roblox. I can't post about this online since I would like to not give up my identity (just like a pen name), but I would not mind talking about it in a broader perspective (interviews).

I've been part-time self-employed to some extent with some startup game developers (often logistical game features rather than frontend or complex physics) during 2019-2021. I often had to communicate with people from other countries and it taught me valuable digital communication, especially when time was important.

I also worked on several other game ideas, some with a friend who helped me build assets, but I have never published them since I often felt like I lacked crucial skills to complete them (game development is difficult). To compare my growth, it once took me a week to implement a proper inventory system. It would take me much less than half a day now to complete a proper and tested inventory system in-game. Object-oriented development definitely helps here (Lua doesn't have classes like Python/Java).

Of the most impressive small things I made, I have put them on my page and encourage you to view to have a feel for what my older code looks like. Of course, I don't actually write code like what you see now (seriously, I decided it was a good idea to spawn every instantiation?). Though, maybe the interpreter repository is a lot closer since I made it only a year ago as of writing.

One of my goals (that I am being patient for, but hopefully not forever waiting) is to get my work in progress game up and going, and revive an older game project for which I am constantly thinking ideas for.

I'm invested into learning Unity again someday, probably through a college course for now since I am still thinking of what kind of game idea that would motivate me to make a Unity game yet.

## Programming Languages
I scripted in Lua for about several years (rough minimum estimate) and started transitioning to other languages and eventually computer science.
My first programming language after Lua was JavaScript where I made a small tower defense game (check my LinkedIn) and some web design.
Around the same time a few months later, I learned C# in Unity and worked on just simple game mechanics. This was part of a Game Design dual AP course I took and I also did some self-learning outside.
I branched out into trying some node.Js and trying to make website content with HTML,CSS,JS but haven't made something too impressive yet to put on a portfolio/resume.

I learned Python, C, Java throughout my time here in college and also dabbled into React slightly when I was looking for an alternative to the Kivy framework for a freshmen year project.
